BDD :- Behaviour Driven Development

	BDD is an Agile Softwere development methodology in which an application is documented and designed around the behavoiur a user expects to experience when interacting with it.

---***---

	BDD is designed to test an application's behaviour from the end user's standpoint, whereas TDD is focused on testing smaller pieces of functionality in isolation.


BDD involves product managers, developers, and test engineers who collaborate to come up with concrete examples of desirable functionality. There is a high level of communication before any implementation. By comparison, TDD can be done by a solo developer without any external input from product managers or stakeholders.

The TDD test asserts the result of a specific method, while the BDD test is only concerned about the result of the higher level scenario.
